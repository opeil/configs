   Git over an SSH tunnel

   First, we create an ssh session in the master mode with agent forwarding

      ssh -f -N -M -S "~/temp/session:%h" -A -L 9999:bitbucket.org:22 born

   Then, we can do

      git push ssh://localhost:9999/opeil/notes.git

   To close the tunnel

      ssh -S "~/temp/session:%h" -O exit born
